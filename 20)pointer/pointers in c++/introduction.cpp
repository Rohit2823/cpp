/*
pointers ==> variables that store address of another variable

we can modify pointer to point to another datatype

syntax==>
int a;
int *p; ==> p is variable which       can store a address of variable

to store address of a in p 
p = &a;

if we print p , &a, then it will give adress of variable which pointers points to.

if we print &p then it will give address of p that means pointer.

if we try to print *p then it will give value of variable which is adresssing in pointer 
'we can modify variable value also
