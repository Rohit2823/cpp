//  learning hello world program

#include<iostream>
int main(){
    std::cout<<"helloworld\n";
    return 0;
}

// #include is preprocessor directive
//             used to include files
//             if we want to add some files in our program then for that we use this

// here we include iostream fie
//             header file to taking input and printing output
//             here we are printing output with the help of cout. cout will only work if we have include iostream file

// main        the exicution of code begins from main function (mandatory form any program)

// std::cout   this display whatever we have written in quatation marks
//             cout is belongs to namespace std and we have to specify std belongs to what.

// /n          adds line break

// ;           marks end of the statement 

// return o    exit status of a function

// {}          indicate start and end of function
